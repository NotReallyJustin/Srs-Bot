# Senior Working at Generic Tech Company!
***
“I’m so excited to announce that I’ll be
working for Generic Tech Company in the fall!
It’s a Silicon Valley company that’s disrupting
the industry through blockchain, or machine
learning, or something. Actually, I’m not entirely sure what they do. The important part is
that I’m getting paid more than you. <br />
As a graduate from one of the fi nest engineering institutions in the world, perhaps
it’s my responsibility to make sure that the
environment won’t become even more of
a dumpster fire than it already is, or to improve life for the nearly one billion people
who lack access to clean drinking water, or
to, I don’t know, cure cancer or some other
altruistic bullshit. But, as someone who
wants lots of money, it’s also my responsibility to accept it when it is offered to me.
Y’know, this was always my dream.  <br />
When I applied to MIT as a wide-eyed high school
senior, I knew exactly what I wanted to do:
solve fascinating problems and change lots of
people’s lives. Now that I’m joining Generic
Tech Company’s ads optimization team, I’ll
get to do exactly that, and also make twice the
average American household income at age
twenty-two. <br />
Sure, maybe in a decade or two, I’ll be
sleepless at night, staring into the void and
fretting about whether I’ve wasted my career on some frivolous code. But hey, at
least I’ll be sleepless at night with a cool
few million, badass health insurance, and airpods.

# MIT Food
## A collection of hungry beavers confessing on facebook
***
Help I ordered food from ubereats and apparently my driver came at the exact same time as another driver delivering a different order because instead of my vegan salad bowl I ended up with a very much non-vegan burger and chicken strips. I even asked the driver if it was for me and from sweetgreen and he said yeah. Now I've accidentally stolen somebody's meal, I can't read the name on the receipt because it's drenched in grease, the driver's long-gone, I can't find the driver who actually has my salad bowl, and I have no clue how to get it back to them. I can't even eat this meal, since it's not vegan. Also currently spiraling rn because someone, somewhere out there, is probably pissed and thinks I've malociously stolen their order. What do. <br /><br />

Shout out to new house dining for either being too disgusting to eat or giving me food poisoning multiple days a week!<br /><br />

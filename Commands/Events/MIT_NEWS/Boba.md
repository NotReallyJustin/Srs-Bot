# MIT Faculty votes to replace dining with boba
## Letter from Admin
***
Dear Students,
We write today to let you know that
the faculty approved a proposal that your
input helped to shape. Boba sales will
replace dining halls from now on. We
were motivated by two primary objectives
as we sought to collect input about, and
build support for, this change: (1) increase
number of calories consumed by students;
and (2) address concerns we‚Äôve had about
students delaying boba consumption, or
being forced to walk up to a half mile to
acquire their daily dose of boba.<br />
Avid boba drinker Pearl T. ‚Äô22 brought
this concern to our attention during the
‚ÄúRedesigning the First Year‚Äù class over IAP.
‚ÄúSometimes I wake up in the morning and
can barely bring myself to get out of bed,
let alone walk all the way from Maseeh to
the stud so I can buy boba,‚Äù she mumbled.
Next House residents also expressed
concerns. ‚ÄúBy the time I get to Lobby 10
in the morning, I am completely out of
energy,‚Äù wheezed [funnier name] ‚Äô19. ‚ÄúBecause of the new meal plans this year, I‚Äôm
not eating enough calories in the dining
halls, so boba is the only thing keeping me
going.‚Äù <br />
You may recall that we wrote to you
in January to ask for input on potential
changes to the meal plan, including increasing  exibility and dining dollars. We
completely ignored your input, opting for
the solution that we had envisioned all
along. You should be aware that implementing boba in place of dining halls in
all dorms will cause the following changes
beginning next fall: (1) boba prices will
increase to the universally a ordable
$66.66 per drink; (2) all boba will start at
250 percent sugar, in order to ease parents‚Äô
concerns that their children are not consuming enough calories; and (3) student
groups will no longer have fundraising opportunities, because administration needs
to pro
 t o of boba more than it needs its
undergraduates to fund literally anything
that isn‚Äôt part of our prepackaged brand.
Faculty voted to approve these changes last  ursday. School of Science Dean
Milk Sipper trembled as he urged to faculty that he has ‚Äúfelt the e ects of boba withdrawal 
 rsthand,‚Äù and wanted to protect
students from the ‚Äúunfortunate sip-toms.‚Äù
He subsequently ran out of the room, yelling something unintelligible about a Syncopasian concert.

week.

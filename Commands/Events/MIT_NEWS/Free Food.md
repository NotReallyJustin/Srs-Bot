## MIT launches a free-food campaign in light of COVID
***
When I was a prefrosh, I was welcomed
to CPW with a plethora of free food options. Science clubs were giving out liquid nitrogen ice cream, fraternities were
giving me steaks and shakes, and boba
rained from the sky (probably). This is
what I was promised when I enrolled at
MIT, but since then, I have gotten nothing
but disappointment.<br />
I remember returning to MIT for my
first day of school, and I couldn’t find any
tables outside the Z Center with free ice
cream. I tried visiting fraternities, but instead of giving me food they just asked me
about my “chill to pull” ratio. This seemed
like a weird question because they were
the ones with the shakes. Also, people pull
chicken and pork, not steaks. I told them
I had none, and was promptly rejected.
Even worse, when I finally found boba, it
was no longer free! <br />
For a moment there was hope. I found
several free food mailing lists, from clubs-with-huge-budgets-and-ordertoo-much-food@mit.edu to hey-guys-ifound-this-private-event-let’s-steal-theirfood@mit.edu. At first I couldn’t tell if
they were pranks, because I’d arrive at the
location ten minutes after the email and
maybe find an empty food tray if I was
lucky. But one day I happened to be in the
room next door when an email was sent
out. I rushed in immediately, only to find
some people with brightly colored hair already leaving with all the trays. I was no
match for the speed and proximity of East
Campus. <br />
I was left with no choice. The only free
food I could get was at boring talks or recruiting events. I’d come, feel pressured to
stay the whole time, and enjoy the same
plain cheese pizza. Whenever the speakers asked if we had any questions, I’d always ask if they could get something different next time, like Mexican food. I can
never find the free Mexican food. But they
would simply laugh until I pretended to
laugh too, plotting my revenge.<br />
So I write this to you, from my room,
bedridden with scurvy, pleading to the
community to get a more diverse selection of free food. I see my classmates give
in to the administration’s evil plot and buy
food, but that is not what we were promised when we were admitted! I promise
this is the hill I will die on, mostly because
of the grease.

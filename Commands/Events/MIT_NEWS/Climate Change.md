# MIT To be Destroyed by Climate Change!
## Don't worry - if we go down, Harvard is going down with us
***
A cold front is moving in over
Cambridge today, bringing with
it intense rain and heavy gusts of
wind. Tents may blow over, and
Killian Court is expected to fl ood
with 2–3 feet of water. <br />
But this is just a taste of what’s to
come. Our climate is changing. In
the next 20–50 years, expect Killian
Court to be underwater, while Stata
Amphitheatre bakes in desert-like
conditions. With the natural gas
that powers the MIT Cogeneration
Plant expected to be used up by
2100, air conditioning, refrigeration, and even lights will be sparse
on campus. If students, faculty, and
staff can make it through the Mass
Ave moat and into the Infinite Corridor, they will be greeted by stifl ing
humidity and kudzu climbing up
and through the glass-walled materials science labs. <br />
In other parts of the country, severe hurricanes and tornadoes are
expected to become daily occurrences because of our negligence as
scientifi c leaders. Florida will have
to be evacuated. Wildfi res will rage
across California, incinerating all
but the strongest of Silicon Valley
billionaire bunkers. <br />
Th ose energy-saving revolving
doors can’t save us now. Enjoy it
while you can, everybody, because
the MIT you know won’t exist much
longer.

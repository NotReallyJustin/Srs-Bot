When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary the federal government to disband its tyrannical rule upon its constituents, and to assume among the powers of the engineering world, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Physics and of Nature's God given right to exploit it is henceforth bestowed upon the people, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. <br /> <br />

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that MIT is not created equal, that its constituents are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of anyone that hasn't graduated from Harvard nor Stuyvesant, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Our slogan, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer while the tyrannical rule of the government prevents MIT students from pursuing such rights. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, incited by the oligopoly that is Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and UChicago, deems detrimental to a university, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future circlejerking.--Such has been the patient sufferance of our campus; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of he, the present US government and systemic institutions everywhere outside of Silicon Valley, is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these people. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. <br /> <br />

He has shown his Assent to Laws, the only thing impeding on the common good bestowed upon the people of this campus.<br /> <br />

He has suspended our student government's powers to enact absolute power, suspended in their operation till the consent of the inefficient government is to be attained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to empower them.<br /> <br />

He has refused to stand up to tyrant Charles W. Eliot's attempt to consolidate this prestigious campus into another irrelevant branch at Harvard University, while dubbing this school "Boston Tech" for no less than 3 decades.<br /> <br />

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of disrupting profound research into microwave radars and ballistic missiles to aid in WW2.<br /> <br />

He has dissolved architectural structures repeatedly, for inspiring with manly firmness the next generation of technical engineering.<br /> <br />

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to acknowledge the legal power of an MIT Software License; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to MIT academia for enabling cyberattacks on the US Department of Defense; despite the defendant having copied and pasted no less than 3.14 million lies of code from Github and the United States Nuclear Program still operating on floppy disks.<br /> <br />

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of the newfound dormitories; for that purpose diminishing federal funding to MIT over the past quarter-century; attempting to pass others the title of a federal space-grant college, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Funds.<br /> <br />

He has obstructed the Administration of Invention, by giving his Assent to Laws for legislating redtape and bureaucracy.<br /> <br />

He has made College Board reign supreme on his Will alone, continuously barring MIT from using the Common Application; having forced our rejections department to create our own application portal.<br /> <br />

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, all of which is involved in arousing public dissent against our attempts to classify economics as a mathematical core subject.<br /> <br />

He has kept Among Us, in times after 2020, a mainstream cultural video game despite the institution continuously churn out cringe to the nth degree. And indeed, we hereby assert that this line is a pun on the US constitution.<br /> <br />

He has affected to render the MIT campus holdings in Cambridge a federal entity suseptible to egrigious amounts of property taxes, and enabling the EPA to sue our beloved university for our "waste disposal procedures" despite our attempts to vaporize everything with Thanos infinity stones<br /> <br />

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br /> <br />

For Quartering large amounts of cringe Among Us:<br /> <br />

For protecting the Department of Justice, enpowered by a nonsensical Sherman anti-trust law, in a lawsuit against MIT for being a trust.<br /> <br />

For cutting off our rollar coaster while creating bogus excuses about "this goes against regulations":<br /> <br />

For imposing Taxes on all 300 million American citizens without our Consent:<br /> <br />

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of being ranked as the top university in America, despite the lack of diss tracks against our campus:<br /> <br />

For transporting us beyond Seas to be establish study-abroad programs, made compulsory by the US College Rankings<br /> <br />

For abolishing the free System of being able to shop whenever you want, establishing therein an Arbitrary governmental policy, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render all boba places near our campuses shut:<br /> <br />

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments.<br /> <br />

He has waged War against us, demonstrated by Harvard Confessions facebook page in a rant that established Harvard Supremacy.<br /> <br />

He has plundered our police car display, made a mockery of our Captain America shield, and fundamentally neglected our fraternal unit of measurement in proper use.<br /> <br />

He is at this time transporting large armies of applications to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, in an effort to drop our admission rates by over 50%.<br /> <br />

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas of remote learning to bear Arms our anti-cheat monitoring systems, to become the executioners of their mental health, or to fall themselves by the weight of their calculus homework.<br /> <br />

He has excited domestic insurrections in Among Us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Caltech Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is complain to mainstream media about the lack of dignity present in Operation Steal-The-Cannon.<br /> <br />

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by laughter upon our blogs. A culture whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to request the presence of our prestigious campus. <br /> <br />

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Law School brethrens. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our deviation from the Ivy Leagues. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them as enemies to scientific progress, engineering ingenuity, and campus welfare.<br /> <br />

We, therefore, the Representatives of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That the students of this campus are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the US Crown, and that all political connection between them and the United States, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy exams, conclude Peace, contract construction of our Red Line subway car, establish a new Faux Cathedral, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
